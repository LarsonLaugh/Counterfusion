# CounterFusion

---

This repository contains relevant algorithms and applications for the paper in preparation.

## Features

- **Detailed Analysis of Markov-process-like interaction**:
- **Computational Demonstrations**: 
- **Visualizations and Plots**: Utilizes Python's plotting libraries to visualize the outcomes of the scattering models
  and their behaviors.

## Prerequisites

To effectively engage with the notebook, the following Python packages are required:

- `numpy`: For handling numerical computations and array operations.
- `matplotlib`: Essential for creating and displaying graphs and visualizations.

## Installation

Ensure you have the necessary packages installed by running:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage
#### Edge class
1. Define interactions
2. Define the sequence of interactions
#### System class
3. Define the system constituted by several Edge instances.
4. Define the individual paths of flows
5. **Analysis and Interpretation**: Discusses how to interpret the results obtained from the simulations, with an
   emphasis on understanding the physical implications.
